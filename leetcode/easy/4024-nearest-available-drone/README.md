# Nearest Available Drone

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given a 2D integer array `drones`, where `drones[i] = [xi, yi, rangei]` represents the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and travel range of the `ith` drone.

You are also given an integer array `target = [tx, ty]`, representing the coordinates of the target.

A drone `drones[i]` can reach the target if the  **Manhattan distance**  between its coordinates and the target coordinates is  **less than or equal**  to its `rangei`.

Return the  **index**  of the reachable drone with the  **minimum Manhattan distance**  to the target. If there is a tie, return the  **smallest index**. If no drone can reach the target, return -1.

The  **Manhattan distance**  between two coordinates `(xi, yi)` and `(xj, yj)` is `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  drones = [[0,0,8],[2,2,9]], target = [3,4]

 **Output:**  1

 **Explanation:** 

- The distance between drones[0] and target is |0 - 3| + |0 - 4| = 7, which is within its range of 8.
- The distance between drones[1] and target is |2 - 3| + |2 - 4| = 3, which is within its range of 9.
- Since drones[1] is the nearest drone, the answer is 1.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  drones = [[2,1,5],[4,4,5],[6,6,8]], target = [5,5]

 **Output:**  1

 **Explanation:** 

- The distance between drones[0] and target is |2 - 5| + |1 - 5| = 7, which is greater than its range of 5.
- The distance between drones[1] and target is |4 - 5| + |4 - 5| = 2, which is within its range of 5.
- The distance between drones[2] and target is |6 - 5| + |6 - 5| = 2, which is within its range of 8.
- Both drones[1] and drones[2] are the nearest drones. Since we should return the smallest index, the answer is 1.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  drones = [[4,4,5]], target = [8,6]

 **Output:**  -1

 **Explanation:** 

- The distance between drones[0] and target is |4 - 8| + |4 - 6| = 6, which is greater than its range of 5.
- No drone can reach the target, so the answer is -1.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= drones.length <= 100
- drones[i] = [xi, yi, rangei]
- target = [tx, ty]
- -25 <= xi, yi, tx, ty <= 25
- 1 <= rangei <= 100

                    answer=i
        return answer
```
