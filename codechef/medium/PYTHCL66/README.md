## Problem

### Else Statement

The else keyword handles the case that don't meet the conditions specified in the if and elif statements. It's like a "none of the above" option in programming.

### Task

Some code is written in the editor.

- Create integer variables r and k - the weight of friends Ram and Karan
- Take user input for r and then k
- Output based on these conditions: If r is greater than k, output "Ram is heavier than Karan" If r is less than k, output "Karan is heavier than Ram" Otherwise, output "Ram & Karan have the same weight"

Your task is to complete the blanks in the code.
