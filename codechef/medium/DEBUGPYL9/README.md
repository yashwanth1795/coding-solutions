## Problem

### Incorrect Index

Listen

Strings in Python have zero-based indexing.
This means that the first index is 0.
It is easy to forget that and use one-based indexing instead.
This incorrect indexing leads to another logical error.

 **Program to print the last character of the string** 

```
s = input()       # input string
n = len(s)        # find length of string

print(s[n - 1])   # Correct way to access the n-th character
print(s[n]) # incorrect way

```

### Task
- Given a program to print 1st, 4th and 6th character of a string
- Find out the logical error and solve it
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
hellohowudoing
```

```

```
